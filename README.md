# E-Supermarket

## Description

The goal of the project is to develop a collaborative system for registering, searching and evaluating super-market consumer goods offers between users. 
The system allows its registered users to inform others about the existence of products that are at a good (by their own criteria) price, working alongside 
existing tools (such as e-katanalotis) which only inform about price but not stock, but also do not include all super-market stores (e.g. local chains, mini-markets). 
The control of the validity of the offers is left to the other users, who have the possibility to validate the offer (like) or show that it is not valid (dislike) or 
that the product is sold out (out-of-stock). Users can also indicate that an offer has ended. To encourage participation, the system rewards users who provide information
with "points".
